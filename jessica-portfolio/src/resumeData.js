    "aboutme":"Hi, I'm Jessica, a passionate full-stack Java developer with a strong commitment to building innovative solutions and contributing to the tech community. I have a deep love for coding and a wealth of experience working on a wide range of web applications and projects. My journey in tech has been filled with exciting challenges and opportunities, and I'm always eager to tackle the next one. Beyond my technical expertise, I'm proud to be actively involved in empowering other Latinas in the tech world. I firmly believe that diversity and inclusion are the keys to innovation, and I'm dedicated to supporting underrepresented groups in technology. Currently, I'm on a learning journey to expand my cloud computing skills, particularly in AWS (Amazon Web Services). Cloud technologies are shaping the future of tech, and I'm excited to be on the forefront of this transformation. When I'm not coding or mentoring, you can find me exploring the latest AWS features, attending tech meetups, or sharing my experiences on social media. Let's connect and embark on this incredible tech journey together!",
